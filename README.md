### Face Recognition and Tracking with DLIB and OCSORT Algorithm

This project employs DLIB, a robust toolkit for machine learning and computer vision applications, specifically for face recognition and face tracking utilizing the OCSORT (Online Continuous SORT) algorithm.

#### Project Objective
The primary goal is to recognize faces and perform face tracking within a given video or set of images. DLIB, a powerful library for facial recognition, is employed for accurate face detection, and the OCSORT algorithm, a variant of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm, is utilized for continuous online face tracking.

### Key Components

#### 1. Face Recognition using DLIB
- **Facial Detection:** DLIB offers sophisticated facial detection capabilities, effectively identifying and localizing faces within images or video frames.
- **Facial Landmark Detection:** It provides functionality to identify facial landmarks, aiding in better understanding facial structures and expressions.
- **Facial Recognition:** Leveraging the power of DLIB's pre-trained models for facial recognition to identify and match faces within images or video streams.

#### 2. Face Tracking with OCSORT Algorithm
- **OCSORT Algorithm:** The OCSORT algorithm provides a method for online continuous face tracking in video sequences.
- **Continuous Object Tracking:** This algorithm ensures the seamless tracking of faces in video frames, managing identity persistence and association across frames.

### Workflow Overview
The workflow consists of the following stages:

1. **Face Recognition:**
   - Utilizing DLIB for face detection, landmark detection, and facial recognition within images or video frames.
   - Identifying and distinguishing individual faces with their unique identities.
   
2. **Face Tracking using OCSORT Algorithm:**
   - Employing the OCSORT algorithm to enable continuous tracking of recognized faces across multiple frames in a video stream.
   - This algorithm assigns persistent identities to faces, enabling continuous tracking even in challenging scenarios like occlusion and varying lighting conditions.

### Application Areas
